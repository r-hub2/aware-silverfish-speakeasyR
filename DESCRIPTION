Description: A graph community detection algorithm that aims to be performant
    on large graphs and robust, returning consistent results across runs.
    SpeakEasy 2 (SE2), the underlying algorithm, is described in Chris Gaiteri,
    David R. Connell & Faraz A. Sultan et al. (2023)
    <doi:10.1186/s13059-023-03062-0>. The core algorithm is written in 'C',
    providing speed and keeping the memory requirements low. This implementation
    can take advantage of multiple computing cores without increasing memory
    usage. SE2 can detect community structure across scales, making it a good
    choice for biological data, which often has hierarchical structure. Graphs
    can be passed to the algorithm as adjacency matrices using base 'R'
    matrices, the 'Matrix' library, 'igraph' graphs, or any data that can
    coerced into a matrix.
